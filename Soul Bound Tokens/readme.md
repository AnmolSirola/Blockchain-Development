## Soul Bound Token

Soulbound tokens (SBTs), or soulbound NFTs, are non-fungible tokens that cannot be transferred to another wallet after they are issued.  
 
Example:- 

A soul bound token is a type of in-game item or currency that is bound to a player's account and cannot be traded or sold to other players. These types of items are often used in online games to represent special rewards or achievements that a player has earned, or to give players access to certain features or content in the game.
There are a few different ways that soul bound tokens can be used in games. For example, they might be used as a currency that players can use to purchase special items or equipment, or to access certain areas of the game that are otherwise locked. They might also be used as a way to track a player's progress or accomplishments within the game, such as by unlocking new abilities or skills as the player progresses through the game.
In some cases, soul bound tokens might be earned through gameplay, such as by completing quests or defeating certain enemies. In other cases, they might be obtained through microtransactions or other means outside of the game itself.
Overall, the use of soul bound tokens can vary widely depending on the specific game and the intended purpose of the tokens.

### How can soulbound tokens be used?

## Educational Transcripts, Diplomas, Certifications
Soulbound tokens provide everyone verifiable credentials. Professors could issue soulbound tokens to their students whenever their students attain certain academic milestones and achievements, such as completing a course or project. When applying to jobs, graduates could choose to share their educational Souls with hiring managers. The hiring managers could look at their Souls & SBTs to see what skills and experiences their candidates verifiably have.
## NFT ownership
Artists can get rid of dishonest individuals selling NFT collections under the guise of famous artists by linking soulbound tokens to their artistic profile. SBTs would allow buyers to trace the social provenance, whereas blockchain inclusion enables them to track when a specific work was created.

## Cons of SBTâ€™s
Along with lucrative advantages, soulbound tokens have some cons, too. For example, the current wallet mix may not be ideal for SBTs due to the lack of community recovery methods. As a result, community recovery wallets need a wide variety of soulbound tokens dispersed throughout several communities to recover lost Souls.
